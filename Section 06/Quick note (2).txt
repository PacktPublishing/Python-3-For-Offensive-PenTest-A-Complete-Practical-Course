Quick note
Hello guys, 


The next lectures are outdated and they used to be working in old versions of Firefox. While they are outdated, I highly recommend to still watching them as you might learn something advance in passwords hacking.

I showed a PoC of man-in-the-browser technique in Python. This technique was all about getting passwords via intercepting web browsers API calls.
