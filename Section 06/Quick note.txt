Quick note
Hello guys,

The next lectures ( #36,37,38 ) are recorded in Python 2.7 on Windows 7. However almost the same exact code works on Windows 10 with Python 3. For example instead of print X , in Python 3 itâ€™s print (x).

I already updated the codes to Python 3 and tested them. If you downloaded the scripts, then you will get the updated Python 3 version and you can simply follow the videos as they are still valid. 

Should you have any questions, please let me know.
