Exercise Overcome Empty String
Overcome Empty String

In a previous video we have seen that when we hit enter key multiple times our shell breaks due to improper handling of empty string. In this exercise you have to fix this problem.

Hint

The simplest way to solve this issue is by adding a new line in our server code saying if the user input was empty string ' ' then we do nothing or we may send a trivial command like whoami.
