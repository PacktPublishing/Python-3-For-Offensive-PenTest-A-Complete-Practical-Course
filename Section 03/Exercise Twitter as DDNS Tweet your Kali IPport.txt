Exercise Twitter as DDNS Tweet your Kali IPport
Avoid using your personal twitter account during penetration testing.

1. Create a new twitter account for testing purposes.

2. Tweet your kali IP address and a port number of your choice.

3. From the Windows (Target) machine retrieve the HTML of

httpstwitter.comYourAccount and parse the tweet which you have just created.

4. Use our previous persistent reverse TCP shell (which we created in module 2) and instead of hardcoding the IP address of the Kali, make it dynamically changing based on the latest tweet.

5. Verify that the connection to the kali is successful.
